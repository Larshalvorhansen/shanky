# Flashcard Deck Manager

**Shanki** is a Python-based command-line flashline application. It uses spaced repetition (specifically the [Leitner verison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system)) for improved memory retention and provides features for reseting, editing flashcards and practice statistics.

It is free ofcource and designed to be super simple to use.

## How to use **Shanki**:

1. Clone this repo
2. run main.py
3. (optional) add you're own deck(s) in the ./decks folder using the same format as in exampledeck.csv

> It's called Shanki as in "Anki for the shell" :)
